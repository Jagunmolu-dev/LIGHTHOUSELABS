# Final-Project-Tableau
## Project/Goals
Review the file [faa_data_subset](https://github.com/Jagunmolu-dev/LIGHTHOUSELABS/blob/main/Final-Project-Tableau/Project%20Files%20-%20Tableau%20-%20Option%202/faa_data_subset.xlsx) to demonstrate insights from the data

## Process
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)

## Results
Option 2 was selected and the data set used was

1. Show the number of strikes per State

## Challenges 
> Ability to relate to the data, had to do some research to understand the data

## Future Goals
If i had more time, i would dig deep into the dato to understand some of the parameters and make better visualizations that profer solutions to business needs
