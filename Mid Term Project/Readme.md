# Mid-Term Project-

## Project/Goals
> Set a well-defined problem with impact clearly identified;
> Execute the data analysis techniques learned throughout the program;
> Demonstrate insights and potential solutions via a dashboard that incorporates best practices of data visualization and is appropriate for a non-technical audience;
> Create instructions for users to interact with the dashboard.

## Process
### Got the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heeraldedhia/bike-buyers?select=bike_buyers_clean.csv)
### Performed Exploratory data analysis on the dataset to understand what the dataset is all about
### Compared each of the variables to know which demography are more likely to purchase a bike 

## Results
> Comparing all factors to show demographics of who is likely to purchase a bike

From the output above we can see that those with a lesser commute time are more likely to purchase a bike than those with a longer commute time which is clearly shown in the image below

> Compared the count of those who purchased a bike by the income

From the chart provided above we can see that those whose income is between 40,000 and 70,000 are most likely to purchase a bike and we see that as income increases the probability of purchasing a bike reduces as seen in the boxplot below which shows some rare occurrences of those with higher income purchasing a bike

> A moderate positive linear relationship between the ages of those who purchased a bike and the number of children

> Finally we can see that gender does not have a considerable effect on whether a bike is purchased or not
