# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
Pull data from 3 API's, merge them then model them to look for any statistical relationships to demonstrate [Python Statistical](https://github.com/Jagunmolu-dev/LIGHTHOUSELABS/blob/main/Project-Python_Statistics/assignment.md) assignment.

## Process
Grab live data from CityBikes API
Specifically generated a list of ebike stations in limerick, Ireland (23 stations found)
Python code in notebook [city_bikes.ipyb](https://github.com/Jagunmolu-dev/LIGHTHOUSELABS/blob/main/Project-Python_Statistics/notebooks/city_bikes.ipynb)

                  All ebike Stations in Limerick, Ireland as of June 3, 2023


# Step 2: FourSquare and YELP API's
used API's to find Points of Interest (POI's) near each of the stations
specifically looked within 1000m for "Bars and resturants" 
Python code in notebook [yelp_foursquare_EDA.ipynb](https://github.com/Jagunmolu-dev/LIGHTHOUSELABS/blob/main/Project-Python_Statistics/notebooks/yelp_foursquare_EDA.ipynb)

## Results
## Quality of APIs
Result generated from Yelp POI results produced more valuable result compared to the FourSquare which may be because of the category selected of "Bars and Restaurants"

## Exploraty Data Analysis (EDA)
During EDA, various visualization techniques were applied to explore the data and extract meaningful information
