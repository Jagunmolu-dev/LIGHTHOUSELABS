# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
Pull data from 3 API's, merge them then model them to look for any statistical relationships to demonstrate [Python Statistical](https://github.com/Jagunmolu-dev/LIGHTHOUSELABS/blob/main/Project-Python_Statistics/assignment.md) assignment.

## Process
Grab live data from CityBikes API
Specifically generated a list of ebike stations in limerick, Ireland (23 stations found)
Python code in notebook [city_bikes.ipyb](https://github.com/Jagunmolu-dev/LIGHTHOUSELABS/blob/main/Project-Python_Statistics/notebooks/city_bikes.ipynb)
